# Starting learning Go – a journey for developers


I have been a professional software developer for more than fifteen years. I’m proficient in C/C++ and Python. I know Javascript (with some framework) and Java well. The last language I learned to use (10 years ago) is Python.

After all this time, I had to test myself again with a new language to learn from scratch. I have been cultivating this idea for a long time because I have very little time available due to my working commitments with Globsit. But I had to do it. So, a few months ago, I got organized and started studying Go Lang.

Why Go? I was looking for a relatively new language, complete, fast, and well-supported. At the end of the search, I found two alternatives: Rust and Go. I immediately fell in love with the philosophy of Go: it’s really essential, but all the tools you need in almost every project are already present in the standard library.

Rust, too, is a great language: it’s fast and elegant. Just as Go, Rust is a pragmatic language, which does not force you to follow standard development paths (e.g., OOP) but gives you all the tools to solve all kinds of problems agilely.

It was a difficult choice, and I would like to learn Rust too in the future, but between the two languages, I chose Go for these main reasons:

Go is minimalist, concise, and elegant;
Go has a Garbage Collector: you can easily use pointers without messing the memory;
Go routines are a great way to handle the concurrency;
I like Go official documentation style;
Go is a secure statically-typed language;
Go tools are pretty complete: with a single command, you can manage almost all development phases;
Go can easily integrate C code & libraries.
When I have to learn a new language, I usually choose a good book to start with, and then I continue to learn by creating demo projects using the official documentation as a reference. In this case, I chose The Go Programming Language by Brian Kernighan, a well-written book with lots of examples.

Now I would like to organize test projects in some Open Source repositories that could be useful for both those who program in Go and those who want to learn how to do it. As I organize the code, I will write a series of articles here on my blog. Will these articles become a book? We’ll see…
