# [NLP] Pos Analysis


## Intro

To allow a machine to understand human language, the components of each sentence must be categorized. One of the basic classification systems is the POS (part-of-speach), natively integrated into the nltk library. These tags give each component of the sentence a grammatical meaning.

## NLTK POS tags:

| Abbreviation | Meaning

## Code
Let's do a test with a short script. To run it you need the pip package and the downloader for NLTK. You can find information about the downloader in [this article](https://www.gslf.it/nlp-nltk-downloader/).

```python
import nltk

def pos_tags(sentence):
    tags = nltk.pos_tag(sentence.split())

    for tag in tags:
        print("[{}] {}".format(tag[1], tag[0]))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    sample_sentence = "The brown fox is quick and he is jumping over the lazy dog"
    pos_tags(sample_sentence)
```

The result is this:
```
[DT] The
[JJ] brown
[NN] fox
[VBZ] is
[JJ] quick
[CC] and
[PRP] he
[VBZ] is
[VBG] jumping
[IN] over
[DT] the
[JJ] lazy
[NN] dog
```
