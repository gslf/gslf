# Hugo Startup


I started to play with Hugo today!

Tired of the complexity (useless for a site like this) of Wordpress, and in love as always with VIM and the CLI, I switched to Hugo, a tool for publishing sites based on markdown plain text files. Now I can manage all site configurations and content via command line. At the moment everything is hosted on GitHub, in the main repository of my account.

Hugo's setup is simple, I followed the [official quick start guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) and I finished all steps in half an hour. As a theme I am using LoveIt, it is open source and you can [download it here](https://hugoloveit.com).

So far, using hugo has been fun. I need a little time to understand how this new installation will behave in everyday use.
